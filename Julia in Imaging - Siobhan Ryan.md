###Image packages in Julia 
Julia has a few packages aimed at image processing. Weâ€™ll start by looking at the **TestImages package**, which hosts a selection of sample images, then briefly visit the ImageView package before moving onto the Images package, which implements a range of functions for image manipulation.
###Testimages package
The TestImages package currently provides 25 sample images, which form a convenient basis for experimentation.
